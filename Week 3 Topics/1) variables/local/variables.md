# A variable is a named storage location for a value. It is called variable because the information stored in that location can be changed when the program is running.

# To assign a variable a value, use the equal sign.
# For example:
x = 8

# This assignment statement declares a variable named x and gives it the value 8. The equal sign is called the assignment operator.

# We can later use the variable name to access its value.
