# Assignment Operators

In Ruby assignment operator is done using the equal operator "=". This is applicable both for variables and objects, as strings, floats, and integers are actually objects in Ruby, you're always assigning objects.

Operator	Name	Description	Example
=	        Equal operator "="	Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand	
                            z = x + y will assign value of a + b into c
+=	        Add AND	Adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand	
                            x += y is equivalent to x = x + y
-=	        Subtract AND	Subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand	
                            x -= y is equivalent to x = x - y
*=	        Multiply AND	Multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand	
                            x *= y is equivalent to x = x * y
/=	        Divide AND	Divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand	
                            x /= y is equivalent to x = x / y
%=	        Modulus AND	Takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand	
                            x %= y is equivalent to x = x % y
**=	        Exponent AND	Performs exponential calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand	
                            x **= y is equivalent to x = x ** y
